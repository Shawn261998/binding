            <h2> Chapter 2: Challenges and Resistance to Change </h2>

            <p class="body-text"> As design expands its horizons in the 21st century, a host of challenges emerges, accompanied by a notable resistance to change within the realm of design education. This chapter delves into the complex landscape of these challenges, rooted in the reluctance of educational institutions to adapt to the contemporary demands placed on designers.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The resistance to change is particularly evident in the perpetuation of traditional craft-centric approaches, where an emphasis on skills like drawing and model building persists. This chapter examines the implications of such resistance, questioning the adequacy of these entrenched methods in preparing designers for the diverse and intricate demands of the modern design landscape.</p>

            <p class="body-text">A key aspect under scrutiny is the lack of specialization in design education, where students are required to undergo extensive training in traditional skills. This raises questions about the adaptability of designers in a rapidly evolving technological and social environment. The reluctance to incorporate a deeper understanding of technology, business dynamics, and social sciences reflects a resistance that must be addressed to ensure the relevance of design education in the contemporary era.</p>

            <p class="body-text-last">Ultimately, this chapter serves as a rallying cry for change, urging design education to shed its traditional constraints and embrace a paradigm shift. By understanding the need for transformation, we pave the way for a reimagined educational landscape that empowers designers to thrive in an era defined by technological advancement, interdisciplinary collaboration, and evolving societal needs.

            <blockquote>
                "There is no evidence for the statement that designers think by drawing. It is similar to the old belief that studying Latin or Greek led to better thinking for which there was also no evidence. 2. Yes, designers think by making things, by drawing and constructing. This is the argument for making design (and more generally, sketching) a critical part of the curriculum for all designers, even those who design abstract things such as experience and interaction, services and strategies. 3. There is truth to the statement that designers think by drawing, but imperfect, very rough sketches will suffice. The extreme emphasis on the development of high technical skills is misplaced. Yes, product designers might need this, but everyone else would do far better to learn rapid sketching techniques as an enhancement of the creative process. Today, drawing is taught as an exercise in its own right instead of as one of the multiple components of creative thinking."
