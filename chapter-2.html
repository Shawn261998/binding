                    <h2> Chapter 2: Challenges and Resistance to Change
                    </h2>

                    <p class="body-text"> 
                    The final chapter presents Norman's call for a fundamental shift in design education. He argues for the importance of incorporating science, math, and technology into the curriculum, emphasizing the practical knowledge required by modern designers. The chapter explores the role of drawing in design thinking and challenges the excessive emphasis on high technical skills.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">Norman advocates for the development of experimental methods appropriate for the practical world of design, stressing the need for collaboration in multidisciplinary teams. He contends that design needs its own courses tailored to the practical requirements of the profession, rather than borrowing directly from other disciplines. The author argues that designers, as practitioners, require practical information, approximations, and good-enough knowledge, distinct from the theoretical focus of many other disciplines.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">The chapter highlights the importance of learning to work in multidisciplinary teams, emphasizing that modern design is not conducted in isolation. Norman discusses the need for designers to cooperate with individuals from various disciplines, including engineers, social scientists, and business professionals. He emphasizes that effective collaboration in true multidisciplinary teams is critical for successful design education.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">Norman concludes the chapter with a plea for the design profession to overcome defensiveness, recognize the diverse needs of students, and proactively lead the transformation of design education into the 21st century. He underscores the need for a curriculum that imparts substantive knowledge while equipping designers with the tools and skills relevant to the contemporary design landscape. The chapter ends with a call to preserve the delightful components of design while adapting to the evolving demands of the profession.</p>

                        A major part of design curricula has to do with drawing. “Drawing is essential, ” I am told. “Designers think by doing. We think by drawing.”

                            "1.There is no evidence for the statement that designers think by drawing. It is similar to the old belief that studying Latin or Greek led to better thinking for which there was also no evidence."

                        <blockquote> 
                            "2. Yes, designers think by making things, by drawing and constructing. This is the argument for making design (and more generally, sketching) a critical part of the curriculum for all designers, even those who design abstract things such as experience and interaction, services and strategies."
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote> 
                            "3.There is truth to the statement that designers think by drawing, but imperfect, very rough sketches will suffice. The extreme emphasis on the development of high technical skills is misplaced. Yes, product designers might need this, but everyone else would do far better to learn rapid sketching techniques as an enhancement of the creative process. Today, drawing is taught as an exercise in its own right instead of as one of the multiple components of creative thinking."
