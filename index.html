			<h2> Introduction: Designing Boundaries</h2>

			<p class="body-text"> In the ever-evolving landscape of creativity, design stands as both a reflection of our aspirations and a catalyst for change. "The Shifting Canvas: Exploring Design's Boundaries through Education, Speculation, and Limitations" invites you on a journey into the heart of design, where the realms of education, speculation, and inherent limitations intersect and shape the narrative of a discipline constantly reinventing itself.</p>

			<p class="body-text">As we embark on this exploration, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads of tradition and innovation, where the foundations of design education are reshaped by the digital age. The first section of our journey delves into the rich tapestry of design education. We unravel the historical threads, examining how design learning has transformed over the years, and explore the intellectualization of design, where writing and research become integral to the designer's toolkit. Design schools, often considered crucibles of creativity, are also envisioned as think tanks, incubators of ideas that transcend the classroom, influencing not only the designers of tomorrow but the very essence of design itself.</p>
