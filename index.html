				<h2> Introduction: Designing Boundaries</h2>
				<p> In the ever-evolving landscape of creativity, design stands as both a reflection of our aspirations and a catalyst for change. "The Shifting Canvas: Exploring Design's Boundaries through Education, Speculation, and Limitations" invites you on a journey into the heart of design, where the realms of education, speculation, and inherent limitations intersect and shape the narrative of a discipline constantly reinventing itself.</p>

			<p class="intro-body-text"> As we embark on this exploration, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads of tradition and innovation, where the foundations of design education are reshaped by the digital age. The first section of our journey delves into the rich tapestry of design education. We unravel the historical threads, examining how design learning has transformed over the years, and explore the intellectualization of design, where writing and research become integral to the designer's toolkit. Design schools, often considered crucibles of creativity, are also envisioned as think tanks, incubators of ideas that transcend the classroom, influencing not only the designers of tomorrow but the very essence of design itself.</p>
	
			<p class="intro-body-text-para"> Venturing further, we encounter the speculative realms of design. Here, the canvas expands beyond the tangible, embracing the imaginative, the futuristic, and the transformative. Speculative design, with its ability to envisage possible futures, challenges us to question the status quo and consider the potential impact of design beyond the present moment. This section examines the principles and applications of speculative design, how it interacts with reality, and the ethical considerations that accompany the act of designing the future.</p>
				
			<p class="intro-body-text-para">Yet, within this expansive canvas, there are limits – boundaries that design cannot surpass. In the final section, we confront the inherent constraints of design, acknowledging its imperfections and learning from its failures. The book explores instances where design falls short, recognizing the delicate balance between optimism and a realistic understanding of what design can truly achieve. By acknowledging these limitations, we open the door to conversations about ethics, socio-political responsibilities, and the broader context within which design operates.</p>
				
			<p class="intro-body-text-para">"The Shifting Canvas" is an invitation to reflect on the past, engage with the present, and imagine the future of design. It is a call to those who shape the creative landscape – designers, educators, and enthusiasts alike – to explore the boundaries of their discipline, challenge assumptions, and contribute to a collective dialogue that reshapes the very essence of design in our ever-shifting world.</p>
