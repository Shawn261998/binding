            <h2> Chapter 3: Challenges and Resistance to Change </h2>

            <p class="body-text"> In the face of persistent challenges and resistance within design education, there arises a compelling call for transformation. This chapter delves into the imperative need to redefine and modernize design education to meet the demands of the contemporary design landscape.</p>

            <p class="body-text">A focal point of transformation is the role of drawing in design thinking. While recognizing the historical significance of drawing as a thinking tool, questions are raised about whether highly technical drawing skills are universally essential for all designers. The chapter engages in a critical examination of the nature of creativity in design and challenges conventional notions regarding the prerequisites for effective design thinking.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Furthermore, the chapter emphasizes the necessity for designers to work in multidisciplinary teams. It underscores the importance of collaboration with professionals from diverse fields, extending beyond the traditional confines of design. Working alongside engineers, social scientists, and business professionals becomes paramount in addressing the complex and interconnected challenges posed by contemporary design projects.</p>

            <p class="body-text-last">This chapter serves as a rallying cry for change within design education, advocating for a reevaluation of established practices. By recognizing the need for transformation, it lays the groundwork for a reimagined educational framework that equips designers with the skills and perspectives necessary to navigate the complexities of the modern design profession.</p>

                "We must not lose the wonderful, delightful components of design. The artistic side of design is critical: to provide objects, interactions and services that delight as well as inform, that are joyful. Designers do need to know more about science and engineering, but without becoming scientists or engineers. We must not lose the special talents of designers to make our lives more pleasurable.""
