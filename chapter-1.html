                        <h2> Chapter 1: The Evolving Landscape of Design Education </h2>

                        <p class="body-text"> In the 21st century, design has transcended its traditional boundaries, extending far beyond the creation of simple physical products. The contemporary designer is now faced with a myriad of challenges, from crafting meaningful interactions and experiences to developing innovative services and strategic solutions. This expanded scope necessitates a comprehensive understanding of advanced technologies, intricate business dynamics, and the complexities of human psychology.</p>

                                    
                        <p class="body-text"> This chapter serves as an exploration of the changing face of design, highlighting the imperative for educational institutions to move beyond conventional paradigms. As we delve into the challenges and opportunities presented by this evolution, we lay the groundwork for understanding the resistance to change within design education, a hurdle that must be overcome to align with the demands of the contemporary design profession.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">The evolution of design into these multifaceted domains challenges the traditional approaches rooted in the mid-20th century. In exploring this transformation, we recognize that design education must adapt to equip designers with the skills necessary to navigate this complex and interconnected landscape. No longer confined to the creation of tangible objects, designers are now orchestrators of experiences and strategists shaping the future.</p>
